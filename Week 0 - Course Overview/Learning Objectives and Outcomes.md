# Course Purpose and Learning Outcomes

## Origin of the Course
When looking across analytics add-ons to MBA and MAC programs in the industry, I had a few broad concerns:
1.  If a manager or executve asked a graduate about how to modernize their analytics program, they could not provide a solid holistic recommendation
2.  Graduates wouldn't be able to speak to things like open-source, infrastructure, software development lifecycle, and the technology and analytics landscape
3.  Students focus heavily on either EXCEL or niche progams not widely used in industry - there would be limited awareness of modern data science and analytics techniques

## Course Purpose
The purpose of this course is to prepare accounting graduates for the future of business. 
*  Many companies are becoming more and more like tech companies, with key portions of value being derived from virtual offerings as opposed to physical assets. 
*  Even businesses backed by traditional physical assets are using data more then ever to compete globally and make better decisions.
This course should help students understand the analytics and technology landscape required to remain competitive.

## Course Learning Outcomes and Objectives
1.  Students understand the data analytics pipeline and appropriate technologies.
2.  Students able to identify and survey key tools and technologies that are relevant to support modern analytics pipelines
3.  Students able to relate these concepts to various accounting processes to be able to advocate and measure changes that can create business value
4.  Students can comfortably speak with technology, accounting, and data science teams to enhance business and accounting processes to create value
5.  Students understand modern and emerging technologies such as cloud, blockchain, artifical intelligence, APIs, and platforms

## Setting expectations
We have five weeks - staying on top of technology and analytics trends can feel daunting, so this class will instead try to instill best practices for continuous learning so that students and graduates can continue to apply these techniques to stay competitive and relevant years into the future.
