## Linear Regression (Continuous) Numerical Modeling Techniques
Technique | Regularization | Kernels | Other Names
--- | --- | --- | ---
Linear Regression | No | No | Multiple Regression
Ridge Regression | Yes | No | L2 Regularization, Tikhonov Regularization
Kernel Ridge Regression | Yes | Yes | Supper Vector Regression (SVR)
Support Vector Regression | Yes | Yes | Kernel Ridge Regression

Suppor Vector Regression (SVR) is part of the family of Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Kernels and Regularization are hyperparameters
