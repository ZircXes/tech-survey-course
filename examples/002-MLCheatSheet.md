## Linear Regression (Continuous) Numerical Modeling Techniques
Technique | Regularization | Kernels | Other Names and Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
Linear Regression | No | No | Multiple Regression
Ridge Regression | Yes | No | L2 Regularization, Tikhonov Regularization
Kernel Ridge Regression | Yes | Yes | Supper Vector Regression (SVR)
Support Vector Regression | Yes | Yes | Kernel Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression | Yes | Yes | L1 Regularization
Elastic Net Regression | Yes | Yes | Hybrid L1+L2 Regularization

Suppor Vector Regression (SVR) is part of the family of Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Kernels and Regularization are hyperparameters
Kernels essentially embed feature engineering assumptions across the feature-set
