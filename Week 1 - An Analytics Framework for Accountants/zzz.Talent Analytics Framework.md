# Talent Analytics Framework

## Specialization Topics and Teams
How do teams divide up the labor of building out analytics pipelines and specializations?

### Technology
Technology teams are often divided into a few key groups related to this process:
1. Architecture or Data Engineering
2. User interfaces and applications
3. Data governance
4. Data management

These teams may be closely integrated if a business has adopted Agile or is using DevOps with **continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD)**.
**Architecture or Data Engineering**: Designs technology process or data schema to support reusability and scalability
**User interfaces**: How events are managed, generated, captured
**Data governance**: Guidance on how data should be monitored, controlled, and used; often works closely with SOX teams
**Data management**: Operational technology team to oversee on-premise or cloud-based storage and data systems.

### Analytics
Analytics users typically have a variety of specializations, although dedicated resources, quantitative analysts, and data scientists may have overlap across multiple skills.
These have been ordered in terms of complexity or difficulty of the appropriate skillset. There list is flexible as different cases can be easier/harder.
1. Ad-hoc analytics in MS Office
2. Advanced Visualization (e.g. Tableau or PowerBI)
3. Advanced Reporting (Linking data from prepared data marts or cubes for analysis or business use)
4. Data aggregation and mining (More granular knowledge, typically SQL or noSQL techniques to pull from data lake)
5. Forecasting 
6. Modeling, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
7. Unstructured data analysis (e.g. text analysis or text mining, or natural language processing)
8. Optimization

Roles 4, 6, 7, and 8 are typically performed by data-scientists or quantitative analysts.
Roles 1, 2, and 5 are commonly performed by traditional analysts.
Role 3 is a hybrid role that is typically performed by advanced analysts or specialists with some data/SQL/technology knowledge (hybrid).
