# Data-driven decision making
## What is data-driven decision making and how does it relate to analytics?

Data-driven decision making is using analytics and data to inform decision-making. Traditional decision making was based on those with experience or seniority in a group. While experience and seniority often improve decision outcomes, there can be biases and gaps in which decisions maed are sub-optimal. New or alternative ideas may be quashed instead of evaluated for potential value. Data-driven decision making still needs subject matter expertise; however, data and experimentation informs the decision-making process.
