# Data-driven decision making
## What is data-driven decision making and how does it relate to analytics?

Data-driven decision making is using analytics and data to inform decision-making. Traditional decision making was based on those with experience or seniority in a group. While experience and seniority often improve decision outcomes, there can be biases and gaps in which decisions maed are sub-optimal. New or alternative ideas may be quashed instead of evaluated for potential value. Data-driven decision making still needs subject matter expertise; however, data and experimentation informs the decision-making process.



### Example: Optimizing your Accounts Receivable Collection
Example levels of Maturity for data-driven decision making
0. No tracking of aging or performance - team works to collect on receiveables based on oldest account
1. Simple KPI based prioritization of work activities (e.g. aging or aged dollars outanding)
2. Simple segmentation or behavioral heuristic to improve performance collections.
3. A single model, refit annually that includes segmentation and/or recommended priorities or actions to improve collections
4. Data-driven decision framework with experimentation that includes A/B testing and experiments to see which activities improve collections throughout the year

Key observations on data-driven decision making is that decisions are:
* Made more quickly
* Are measured
* Are formed as an experiment
* May involve modeling or statistics
* Depend on adequate data collection and capture
* Requires concious effort to rely on data as opposed to a general practice or what has worked in the past
