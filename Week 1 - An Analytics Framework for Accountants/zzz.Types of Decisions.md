# Two types of decisions
*  Type A decisions: Non-reversible
*  Type B decisions: Reversible

Based on Jeff Bezos (Amazon) framework for decision-making. 
Type A decisions have consequences if the wrong selection is picked. These decisions should receive strong analytical support, socialization, and should not be rushed.
Type B decisions should be encouraged to experiment with quickly (fail/learn fast). The cost of wrong decisions may be lower for Type B and as such analytical support should exist but can also be developed along the way to test the decision out. If the decision is poor, management can backpedal.

### Example: Accounting Elections
Accounting elections and decisions are classically Type A decisions in that elections and decisions that inform financial and regulatory reporting should not be changed frequently, especially for publicly traded companies.
